## Reflection

This is the third and final project for Udacity React Nanodegree. This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input. By building this project, I gained an understanding of how to use React Native to build an iOS and Android application.

## Specific Requirements

- Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
- Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
- The front of the card should display the question.
- The back of the card should display the answer.
- Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
- Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.

## Tools Used

- Expo
- React Native Paper
- Styled-Component
- React Navigations
